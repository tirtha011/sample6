What is Helm?

Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes that helps you define, install, and upgrade complex Kubernetes applications.

Analogy: Comparable to package managers like apt, yum, or Homebrew, but for Kubernetes.

Advantages of Helm:

Simplified Deployments: Bundle multiple Kubernetes resources into a single package.

Version Control: Manage application versions and upgrades easily.

Reusable Configurations: Shareable and customizable charts for deploying applications.

Rollback Capabilities: Easily revert to previous versions if something goes wrong. Consistency: Ensure consistent deployments across different environments.
